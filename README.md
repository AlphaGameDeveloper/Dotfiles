My dotfiles for my Linux development machines.

## Where's the rest of it?!
Well, you see, I practically live in the terminal.  My dotfiles are mostly for keeping my `zsh` configuration in sync between machines.  Also, keeping app configs in a dotfiles repo has been a pain, so I don't do that (for now...).

Also, lots of system & application configuration will be stuff I am going to add to my [Mac Development Ansible Playbook](https://github.com/AlphaGameDeveloper/Mac-Development-Playbook)!
